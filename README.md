# AwesomeStartupIdeas

* Instagram Handover 
Different team members take over instagram account of a company for a week. 
Inspired from Razorpay https://www.instagram.com/p/BNHn-u3B8Nb/?taken-by=razorpay

* Influencing the culture 
Different team players influence the team different ways. Help them to make influence without friction
Eg. Dharma influencing MakeMyTrip to use Python (or) Vidya trying to conduct CPL (Carrom Premier League) to engage everyone in the office.
